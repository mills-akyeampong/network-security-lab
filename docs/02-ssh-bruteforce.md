# SSH Brute Force Attack & Defense

## ðŸ”¹ What is SSH Brute Force?
SSH Brute Force is an attack where an attacker repeatedly tries different username/password combinations on an SSH server until they find the correct credentials. Automated tools like Hydra or Medusa can launch thousands of login attempts in seconds.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How the Attack Works
1. Attacker scans for open SSH port (default: 22).
2. Uses a dictionary or brute force tool to guess credentials.
3. If successful, attacker gains unauthorized access to the server.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example Attack Command (Hydra)
```bash
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.20
-l root â†’ username (root)

-P â†’ password wordlist

192.168.1.20 â†’ target IP


ðŸ”¹ Defense Methods

Disable root login over SSH.

Use strong passwords or, better, SSH keys.

Change the default SSH port from 22.

Deploy Fail2Ban to automatically block IPs after failed attempts.


ðŸ”¹ Mitigation Script (Fail2Ban Setup)

See scripts/fail2ban_setup.sh



âœ… Summary

Attack: Automated login attempts on SSH.

Impact: Unauthorized access if weak passwords exist.

Defense: SSH key authentication, disable root login, Fail2Ban.
